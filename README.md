In this project, we implement a DASH web application to display topic modeling on Nationally Determined Contributions(NDCs) which are proposed and submitted by involved parties under Paris Agreement. 

## Topic Modeling 
We provide the Colab notebooks in order, to reproduce our model, please follow the instructions from the Colab Notebooks to download the PDF files, scrape them and do topic modeling on the scraped data.

## Web Application

```
