currently low levels of greenhouse gas ghg emissions afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the world today with an estimated population of million and a per capita gdp of usd afghanistan is highly prone to natural disasters throughout its provinces as a result of climate change it is anticipated that the incidence of extreme weather events including heat waves floods and droughts will likely increase as will climate changelinked disasters such as glacial lake outflows the majority of afghanistans population relies directly or indirectly on the available natural resources for their livelihoods so with these climatic changes the foundation of the countrys economy stability and food security is under threat despite these challenges afghanistan can remain a low emission economy while developing rapidly if under the paris climate change agreement extensive financial and other resources are made available to allow afghanistan to successfully develop and implement low emission development strategies leds and highly effective adaptation and development strategies heads appropriate support in the form of finance capacity building technology and legal assistance is needed for afghanistan to make substantial progress on social and economic fronts while maintaining low per capita ghg emission levels description of fairness and ambition afghanistan recognizes that all countries in the world need to make rapid progress towards lowering or maintaining if already low per capita emission levels to avoid dangerous levels of global warming it is therefore critical that under the paris agreement financial resources capacity building technology transfer and other support is provided to afghanistan in order to enable it to implement leds and heads this will allow afghanistan to continue developing while maintaining low level of emissions and increasing adaptive capacity to climate change there would be lower costs and a clearer development path for afghanistan if it pursued development using mainly fossil fuels as other countries have this would likely result in ghg emission in afghanistan continuing to increase at current rates for the period to and beyond however given the extremely limited remaining global ghg emissions budget afghanistan requires the unfccc the global environmental facility gef the green climate fund gcf and other international institutional arrangements to provide the extra finance and other support needed to successfully implement leds across all sectors of its economy without compromising socioeconomic development goals

change while developing and implementing leds climate change trends impacts and vulnerabilities afghanistan is ranked among the most vulnerable countries in the world to the adverse impacts of climate change afghanistans inc report has documented an increase of c in the countrys mean annual temperature since based upon recent climate observations precipitation patterns have decreased during springtime marchmay by approximately mm; however the total annual precipitation has only slightly decreased by approximately mm since there is a slight increase in precipitation from june until november this implies that afghanistan is already beginning to experience the initial adverse impacts of climate change recent climate projections based on cordex regional climate models and representative concentration pathways rcps indicate that afghanistan will face an overall strong increase in mean annual temperature considerably higher than global mean projections when compared to a baseline period of more specifically under the optimistic scenario rcp the mean of the model ensembles projects a warming of approximately c until and of approximately c until for the pessimistic scenario rcp the models project an extreme warming of approximately c until with further warming up to c by under both scenarios there are regional differences with a higher temperature increases at higher altitudes compared to the lowlands for precipitation a significant mean decrease of precipitation during springtime marchmay for the north the central highlands and the east for both scenarios from until between percent is seen this decrease is offset by a slight increase of precipitation during autumn and wintertime octoberdecember in these regions for the hindu kush area a significant and substantial increase in precipitation during the winter season of approximately percent is seen whereas during spring season precipitation is projected to stay stable for the arid south of the country the models do not project significant trends for precipitation the decrease of precipitation during spring is particularly relevant since during these months the main plant growth for agricultural production takes place in addition the decrease dara climate vulnerability monitor ; germanwatch global climate risk index ; and notre dame global adaptation index representative concentration pathways rcps are ghg emission scenarios adopted by the ipcc to describe four possible climate futures depending on the levels of future global ghgs emitted there are four rcps rcp which assumes that ghg emissions peak between and then decline; rcp which assumes that ghg emissions peak around and then decline; rcp which assumes that ghg emissions peak around and then decline; and rcp which assumes that ghgs emissions continue to rise throughout the st century is projected to take place in the regions with the highest agricultural productivity of afghanistan east north and central highlands in combination with the overall increase in temperature and the related increase in evapotranspiration across the country this will most likely negatively impact the hydrological cycle agricultural productivity and availability of water resources climatic changes are also likely to impact upon the spread of water food and vectorborne diseases presenting considerable health risks to both urban and rural populations finally the aforementioned climateinduced risks and challenges can enhance social inequalities poverty and food insecurity causing considerable and fundamental threats to human life livelihoods property political stability the economy and the environment in afghanistan based upon these climate change projections afghanistans environment will experience considerable changes over the remainder of this century climate change based on sound scientific analysis of climatic changes and uncertainties must be mainstreamed into sectoral planning to reduce the negative impacts of climate change in afghanistan and increase resilience both in rural and urban areas climate change adaptation near and longterm adaptation visions goals and targets afghanistans vision for addressing the adverse impacts of climate change through adaptation aims to protect the country and its population by enhancing adaptive capacity and resilience effectively respond to the vulnerabilities of critical sectors and efficiently mainstream climate change considerations into national development policies strategies and plans in order to achieve this vision a national strategy for climate change adaptation must include community level vulnerabilities and build up their adaptive capacities by investment in short and longterm initiatives shortterm action plans formed part of the napa while the nap will implement both short and longterm priorities these priorities include but are not limited to reducing vulnerability of the country and its population through enhancement of adaptive capacity and resilience and deployment of disaster risk reduction approaches integrating climate change consideration into the national planning processes promoting economic development and sustainable rural livelihoods through sustainable management of environmental resources and increase access to modern forms of efficient and sustainable energy services improvement of technical capacity in governmental institutions adaptive and integrated land and water management improving access by rural communities and farmers to water to support food security reduce poverty and improve agricultural productions raising awareness for people of afghanistan on climate change impacts and adaptation measures current adaptation undertakings and support afghanistan has initiated a number of steps to promote the countrys sustainable development in term of national development policies plans and legal frameworks considerable effort has been placed on addressing environmental challenges disaster risk reduction food security water security protection of forest and rangelands and biodiversity conservation all of which have clear relevance to climate change adaptation some noteworthy examples of such policies and plans that have successfully and explicitly integrated climate change include afghanistan national renewable energy policy anrep national water and natural resource management priority programme strategic national action plan for disaster risk reduction snap national environmental action plan neap national comprehensive agriculture production and market development programme energy for rural development erda national biodiversity strategy and action plan nbsap additional national development policies strategies and plans that currently do not mention climate change but have entry points for the further mainstreaming of climate change include national agricultural development framework nadf national environment strategy energy sector strategy national forestry management plan rangeland management plan strategic policy framework for the water sector in term of programmes and projects support provided by the international community and multilateral agencies have laid the groundwork for building afghanistans adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change major contributors include the tokyo framework bilateral partners global environmental facility gef which has provided support through enabling activities midsize projects and fullsize climate change adaptation projects funded by the least developed countries fund ldcf as well as bilateral donors nongovernmental organizations and the united nations with the scale and urgency of afghanistans adaptation needs additional financial and other resources are strongly needed in order to effectively build the adaptive capacity and resilience of the country and its people before more severe impacts of climate change begin to be felt adaptation needs and means of implementation moi afghanistan faces a number of specific challenges in terms of addressing climate change through adaptation these challenges include but are not limited to funding gaps lack of expertise lack of reliable historical climate data weak public awareness about environmental issues and security afghanistan has identified the following key actions as part of its national adaptation plan nap in order to overcome existing gaps and barriers towards sufficiently addressing its climate change adaptation needs the total estimated cost of full implementation of the nap is usd billion over ten years action

afghanistan has very low relative per capita ghg emissions while emissions were at metric tons co per capita data indicates that per capita emissions were around for making afghanistan one of the lowest ghg emitters globally however the country is on a growth path which is expected to strengthen over the coming years meaning ghg emissions are likely to increase it is important that support be provided to afghanistan to develop leds to minimize the increase in its ghg emissions afghanistans overall ghg emission figures table demonstrate that the most important sources of co emissions are from the landuse change and forestry and energy sectors in terms of ch and no emissions the agriculture sector is the major contributor it is therefore important that greater attention should be focused on ghg mitigation measures within these sectors afghanistan has only started to access unfccc technology transfer opportunities it needs to build national capacity to navigate opportunities and play a more critical role in international negotiations the following mitigation options are designed to enable afghanistan to make a mitigation contribution which is condition on support needs
