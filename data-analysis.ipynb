Based upon recent climate observations, precipitation patterns have decreased \\nduring springtime (March-May) by approximately 40.5mm; however, the total annual precipitation has \\nonly slightly decreased by approximately 30mm since there is a slight increase in precipitation from June \\nuntil November. This implies that Afghanistan is already beginning to experience the initial adverse \\nimpacts of climate change.  \\n \\nRecent climate projections, based on Cordex regional climate models and representative concentration \\npathways (RCPs)6, indicate that Afghanistan will face an overall strong increase in mean annual \\ntemperature, considerably higher than global mean projections, when compared to a baseline period of \\n1986-2006. More specifically, under the “optimistic” scenario (RCP4.5), the mean of the model ensembles \\nprojects a warming of approximately 1.5°C until 2050 and of approximately 2.5°C until 2100. For the \\n“pessimistic” scenario (RCP8.5), the models project an extreme warming of approximately 3°C until 2050, \\nwith further warming up to 7°C by 2100. Under both scenarios there are regional differences, with a higher \\ntemperature increases at higher altitudes compared to the lowlands.  \\n \\nFor precipitation a significant (α=0.05) mean decrease of precipitation during springtime (March-May) for \\nthe North, the Central Highlands and the East for both scenarios from 2006 until 2050 between 5-10 \\npercent is seen. This decrease is offset by a slight increase of precipitation during autumn and wintertime \\n(October-December) in these regions. For the Hindu Kush area, a significant and substantial increase in \\nprecipitation during the winter season of approximately 10 percent is seen, whereas during spring season \\nprecipitation is projected to stay stable. For the arid South of the country, the models do not project \\nsignificant trends for precipitation. The decrease of precipitation during spring is particularly relevant since \\nduring these months the main plant growth for agricultural production takes place.

There are four RCPs: 1) \\nRCP2.6, which assumes that GHG emissions peak between 2010-2020 and then decline; 2) RCP4.5, which \\nassumes that GHG emissions peak around 2040 and then decline; 3) RCP6, which assumes that GHG emissions \\npeak around 2080 and then decline; and 4) RCP8.5, which assumes that GHGs emissions continue to rise \\nthroughout the 21st century.  \\n', 3, 0)\n"
